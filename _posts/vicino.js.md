    "CLOSE, CLOSER" IS THE TITLE OF THE THIRD EDITION OF THE LISBON ARCHITECTURE TRIENNALE, TO BE HELD IN THE PORTUGUESE CAPITAL FROM SEPTEMBER 12 TO DECEMBER 15, 2013.


    The vision proposed this year, as explained by the Chairman of the event José Mateus, looks toward architecture not only as a technical discipline, but above all, as a means of cultural and social survey, as a tool to explore the construction of thought.

    The theme "Close, Closer" in this sense opens to the concept of globalization, the loss of identity of some peoples, but also to the great facilitation of communication.

    The Associated Project, "Vicino, più Vicino" conceived by Giovanni D'Angelo, Luca Ponsi, Olivia Giorgi, Paolo Gaeta, with Nicola Tuan, Italian architects but citizens of the world, has been selected by the jury of the 2013 Lisbona Architecture Triennale.

    The periods of study and work abroad, which allowed the group to think about the concept of space in a transversal way, where an input to understand that the notion of proximity (or, conversely, of distance) is essentially dominated by sensations.

    Hence the idea to build two temporary structures formally identical, consisting of steel scaffolding tubes and covered with fabric (designed by Florence Institute of Design International students Benjamin Ashworth and Ece Sunay), to be placed respectively in two phisically distant, but ideally close cities: Lisbon and Florence.

    Visitors who enter the temporary structure placed in Lisbon will not only have the same visual perceptions of visitors in Florence, but will be strongly connected through motion in space: the movements of visitors who interact with the structure in Lisbon will be processed, through the use of sensors, in sounds (created by Tru West-Marmo Music) heard in the structure of Florence, and vice versa. 

    The selected cities in this way will be virtually connected; distant users, visiting the temporary structures spatially distant, will have the feeling of being temporarily neighbors.
